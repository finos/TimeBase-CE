 * 
 *  <p>At the logical level, a database consists of a number of so-called 
 *  streams. Each stream is a time series of messages for a number of 
 *  financial instruments ("entities"). Multiple streams
 *  can be used to represent data of different frequencies, or completely
 *  different factors. For instance, separate streams can represent
 *  1-minute price bars and tics for the same set of entities. Or,
 *  you can have price bars and volatility bars in separate streams.</p>
